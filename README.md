# fOX - TicTacToe

A minimally functioning TicTacToe Android application!

This app is made for learning purposes only and shouldn't be taken as ground truth for best development practices.

## fOX v1 - core application

[Commit 96690](https://github.com/simplicity-load/fOX/tree/9669077e547074db5b34dfe1ea493071a7eb3fcc)

The TicTacToe logic and the UI that supports the full extent of the game. 

This includes the TicTacToe class, the MainActivity class and the main layout file.

## fOX v1.1 - fragments and navigation

[Commit c2d8b](https://github.com/simplicity-load/fOX/tree/c2d8b4a4370c5e7563c8a40fda5df6840872459c)

This update splits the main activity into fragments and enables navigation between two fragments, the Start screen and the Game screen.
